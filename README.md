# Pig Dice
a game of pig dice made with jQuery

## Synopsis
A very short game of pig dice; 24 point wins the game. Can you win in one lucky go?

## Purpose
Practice JavaScript functions, constructors, prototypes, and separating front-end and back-end logic in one js file. jQuery is used to assist in retrieving values from the page and to add transitions to the view of the game, depending on the phase: starting the game, playing game, and game end with score totals.

## Tech Used
jquery-3.2.1, JavaScript, CSS

## Installation
clone with git or view on gh-pages: [pig-dice-game](ckjpdx.github.io/pig-dice-game/)

## Usage
Enter player names and click start game. The game will randomly choose either player 1 or player 2 to start first. Whoever starts first can roll a "die" (random value from 1-6) and start accumulating score. If they get a '1' as a number they lose all their accumulated points, but they also have the option to hold on to what they have earned thus far and pass the turn to the other player.
